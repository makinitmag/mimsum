#NOTES
-Raised VPS mysql configuration to allocate more memory; torrey's environment was crashing when creating feature (specialy with devel module enabled) (ONGOING)
used drush to export feature to bypass VPS issue and disabled devel and views_ui modules
-It is apparent that we need to watch our footprint. With very little, the site experiences memory issues.
